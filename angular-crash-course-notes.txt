Angular Project structure:
	- e2e: End to end testing goes in this file
	- src: Where all source code of application goes
		- app: This folder contains a module and component
		- assets: static files like images
		- environments: file of different environment configs

	- angularJS is all about ES6
	- Angular 2 and 4 are the same thing. Angular 4 is essentailly angular 2.4

TypeScript:
	- String Typing:
		- optional
		- static typing
	- Object-oriented features:
		- A lot of stuff that java uses
	- Compile-time errors
	- Tooling

Cohesion - In OOP, this is the idea that "things" that are related should go together

Class - group variables and function that are highly related
